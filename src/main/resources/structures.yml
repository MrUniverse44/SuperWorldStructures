# Structures configuration
#
# SuperWorldStructures
# v1.0.0 Beta

# schematics: A random schematic of this path will be selected.
# basement-depth: if you have blocks that should be underground,
#   this is the number of Y-blocks that you want underground,
#   example:
#     if I had a building of 75 blocks high,
#     and I only want 10 to be in the above ground,
#     I would put 60 as the basement-depth.
#
# paste-biome: This option changes the biome of that current location to the schematic biomes. Default: false
# paste-entities: This option spawns entities of the schematic to the specified location. Default: true
#
# spawn-chance: change the chance of a structure to spawn
# anywhere: This path configuration is only for space 'ANYWHERE', this is the Y configuration for the schematic.
#   - SPECIAL MENTION: for UNDER_GROUND, the minY will be used for the min paste location for your schematic.
# rotation: In the rotation you can put 'NONE' to disable rotations, 'RANDOM' for a random rotation or the specified rotation example: rotation: 90
# biomes: Name of the possible biome to spawn this structure. Biome list: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/block/Biome.html
# spaces: GROUND, SKY, ANYWHERE, AIR, UNDER_GROUND
# air: This will paste air blocks of the schematics, disable it if you want to ignore air blocks.
# max: This is the max number of structures in a world of this type. (Put -1 to disable it.)
